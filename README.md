Jarvis is a voice-controlled virtual assistant written in Python that performs a variety of tasks based on user voice commands. This project combines speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and integration with various APIs to create an interactive and efficient virtual assistant.

Features
Voice Commands: Communicate with Jarvis using natural language voice commands.
Web Browsing: Open popular websites like YouTube, Facebook, Stack Overflow, and Google with just your voice.
Email Sending: Send emails effortlessly by providing voice commands for content and recipients.
News Updates: Stay informed with the latest news as Jarvis fetches and reads headlines from the News API.

System Commands: Control system actions such as opening the command prompt, managing the camera, and handling system shutdown or restart.
File Operations: Hide or unhide files and folders, take screenshots, and set alarms.
Temperature Check: Get the current temperature through a Google search and web scraping.
